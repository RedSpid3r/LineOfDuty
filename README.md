# About
I'm an analyst by profession and I thought it would be a fun little side project to map out the relationships and interactions of the LoD characters. I'm aware some parts are a little clustered/messy - I'm working to tidy it up overall, but I hope you enjoy.

These graphs were created using [IBM Security i2 Analyst's Notebook](https://www.ibm.com/ie-en/products/i2-analysts-notebook?lnk=hm) software.
