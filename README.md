### Line of Duty Character Interactions & Relationships

> [[LINK](https://github.com/RedSpid3r/LineOfDuty/blob/main/LoD_Characters_AllSeasons.png)] I'm an analyst by profession and I thought it would be a fun little side project to map out the relationships and interactions of the LoD characters. I'm aware some parts are a little clustered/messy - I'm working to tidy it up overall, but I hope you enjoy.
